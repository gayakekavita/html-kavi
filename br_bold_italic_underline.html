<!-- 
The HTML <b> element defines bold text, without any extra importance.

The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.

The <br> tag inserts a single line break.

The <br> tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.

The <br> tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.
